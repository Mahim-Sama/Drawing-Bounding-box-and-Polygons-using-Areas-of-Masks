# Drawing Bounding boxes and Polygons using areas of Masks
### In this task:
+ I converted Semantic segmentation to object detection(bounding box annotations)
+ I used the Python OpenCV library for the main conversion task
+ I used the images from the dataset _**RescueNet** by **Rahnemoonfar** et.el._ for my task
+ Converted the coordinates of the mask objects to YOLO coordinate format 

## The bounding boxes were drawn considering the object's minimum area so that the bounding boxes don't overlap much
